## Inspiration

I have developed this app after following [Angular & NodeJS - The MEAN Stack Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-2-and-nodejs-the-practical-guide/)

then I refactored it to more modular approach and added the ability to store uploaded images to cloudinary cloud service instead of storing it in the server.
